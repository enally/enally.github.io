I am currently testing the use of MathJax with Jekyll, for any future posts that may require the inclusion of equations. Bear with me if this pae looks a little rough!

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

\\[ {\frac{n^{2}}{x}} - \frac{1}{n^{x}} = \sqrt{23} \\]
