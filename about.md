I'm a 4th year student in Athlone Institute of Technology, currently studying Pharmaceutical Science. 
The hope is to use this as a means to learn how to code, as well as create some applications that are in some way applicable to my course and the field of pharmaceuticals/organic chemistry. I am currently learning Javascript and Python, as well as some R for use in statistical analysis of pharmaceutical processes.
